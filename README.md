## üõéÔ∏è Understanding What a Service Is
### Software Architecture 
Components of software architecture that constitute **applications**.

### Software-as-a-Service
Software delivery model for end users to access **software applications** over the internet.

### Microservices

## üîå Technical Aspects of APIs
Previously, we have had a high-level view of what APIs are and examined their differences with applications. We now take a closer look at their technical details.

### RESTful APIs: the fundamentals
* [What is REST](https://restfulapi.net/)
* [API requests: GET vs. POST](https://www.diffen.com/difference/GET-vs-POST-HTTP-Requests)

### RESTful APIs: states
* [Stateful vs. Stateless: Understanding the Key Differences ](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/cloud/articles/stateful-vs-stateless/)
* [Stateful vs Stateless Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8D6P-6KVNM)
* [Stateful vs Stateless: Full Difference](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/stateful-vs-stateless/)
* [Planning persistent storage](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-private/3.2.x?topic=storage-planning-persistent)

### RESTful APIs: Java implementation
Kudos to Griffin Newbold for the following 2 articles.
* [Easily build a REST API with Spring Framework](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/easily-build-your-rest-api-with-spring-framework-80941c359d44)
* [Building REST services with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/)

### RPC-based APIs
* [RPC in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/)
* [What's the Difference Between RPC and REST?](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-rpc-and-rest/)

### More API Architectures
* [Comparing API Architectural Styles: SOAP vs REST vs GraphQL vs RPC](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/soap-vs-rest-vs-graphql-vs-rpc/)

### Stateful Architecture
REST APIs are stateless because, rather than relying on the server remembering previous requests, REST applications require each request to contain all of the information necessary for the server to understand it; since we have already investigated REST APIs, here are some examples of stateful architecture.
* [Stateful and stateless architecture design](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stateful-stateless-architecture-design-milad-rezaeighale/)
